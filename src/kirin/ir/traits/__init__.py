"""Kirin IR Traits.

This module defines the traits that can be used to define the behavior of
Kirin IR nodes. The base trait is `StmtTrait`, which is a `dataclass` that
implements the `__hash__` and `__eq__` methods.

There are also some basic traits that are provided for convenience, such as
`Pure`, `HasParent`, `ConstantLike`, `IsTerminator`, `NoTerminator`, and
`IsolatedFromAbove`.
