Replaced StageInfo symbol storage from Arc<RefCell<InternTable<...>>> to direct InternTable access and updated all symbol table call sites to use direct references and mutable references.
Fixed derive trait-path and wrapper-generic generation bugs, deduplicated Dialect and AST/EmitIR configuration logic, centralized rustfmt test helpers in kirin-test-utils, and validated the changes with full workspace tests.
Extracted shared derive-dialect context helpers for input conversion, context validation, and statement-info lookup to remove duplicated logic across builder, field-iter, and property derives.
